Due date: 1st week of December 

The D's need varying and skewed the data 

revel-buffer factor -- intorudces a time-varying term. more based on the ph of the ocean. influences the capacity to absorb 
Myles decided against it. 

Is not capturing the acidity complex affecting the accuracy of the model 

Putting the alpha as it stands back in. Currently dependent on temperature, total atmospheric content and u (non-atmospheric carbon -- feeback proportiona to other co2 carbon stores.)

 alpha would be placed next to the 'd'

 can we fit the relationship to the mdoels' set of experiement without introducing non-linearity. Can we understand how far we are. 


next steps:
- zecmip experiments - emissions driven experiments. a1 exp -- put emissions in model so each year co2 emissions rose by 1%. how models behave with emissions perturbations

AGU abstract 


need to communicate with 
-- Myles to check 

Deadline: week 7 of term 
Meeting  : Week 9 of term.

-- post data + code into github and send it to stuart. 
-- throw a few figures from Stuart and get sign off from Eleanors.
